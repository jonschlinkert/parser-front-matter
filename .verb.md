This is similar to a consolidate.js engine, but for parsing. Works with [assemble][], [verb][], [generate][], [update][], express.js, parser-cache, or any application with similar conventions.

## Usage

```js
var parser = require('{%= name %}');
```

## API
{%= apidocs("index.js") %}

## file object

Returned `file` objects have the following properties (no other properties are modified on the given file):

* `data`: data from parsed front matter
* `content`: the content string, excluding front-matter (assemble compatibility)
* `contents`: the content string as a buffer, excluding front-matter
* `orig`: the original content string with front-matter included
